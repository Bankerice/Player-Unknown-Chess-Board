# Chess-Opening-Trainer
Chess-Opening-Trainer (Prone for a rename) is a project designed to facilitate the learning of openings, not through user-submitted or professionally delivered lines, but rather through a user's games from Chess.com (planned to add lichess as well).\

This project was intended to just be a summer project, but it intrigued me the more I worked on it. Currently the game logic and board is implemented, as well as some engine/PGN support.
